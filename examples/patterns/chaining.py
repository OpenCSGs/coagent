Extract only the numerical values and their associated metrics from the text.
Format each as 'value: metric' on a new line.
Example format:
92: customer satisfaction
45%: revenue growth\

Convert all numerical values to percentages where possible.
If not a percentage or points, convert to decimal (e.g., 92 points -> 92%).
Keep one number per line.
Example format:
92%: customer satisfaction
45%: revenue growth\

Sort all lines in descending order by numerical value.
Keep the format 'value: metric' on each line.
Example:
92%: customer satisfaction
87%: employee satisfaction\
